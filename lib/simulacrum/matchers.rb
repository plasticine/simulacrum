The pixel change percentage exceeded the maximum threshold of \

There was a #{comparator.diff.delta}% pixel difference found between \
the reference and the candidate.

Reference: #{component.reference_path}
Candidate: #{component.candidate_path}
Diff:      #{component.diff_path}

Please review the diff and resolve manually.

No reference image found! New candidate created:

      Please inspect this candidate image and if it looks OK then;

        - mark it as a reference image by renaming it to 'reference.png'
        - commit 'reference.png' file to your SCM of choice
        - rerun this spec making sure it passes using the new reference image
